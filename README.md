# MONOS

MONOS computes the weighted straight skeleton of a given monotone polygon.

# Algorithm

The algorithm is based on the following scientific work: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ipl.2014.09.021
"A simple algorithm for computing positively weighted straight skeletons of monotone polygons"

# Input/Output

Reads GraphML .gml or  wavefront .obj format that describes a polygon. Writes the
same format; .obj gets 3D coordinates which can be imported to programs like
Blender.

# ToDo's
- implement weighted bisector (enables weighted variant)
- implement GraphML output
- handle multi events and parallel bisectors/input edges

## Optional ToDo's
- library function
- GUI version

# Requirements 
- C++17 enabled complier (gcc,clang)
- CGAL 
- Linux or Mac OS

# Installation

- git clone https://gitlab.cosy.sbg.ac.at/cg/ord/monos
- mkdir -p monos/build && cd monos/build
- cmake ..
- make -j 

# Usage

<code>monos [-h] [-v|-s] [-obj &lt;filename&gt;] &lt;filename&gt;</code>

| options        | description           |
| -------------:|:------------- |
|  -h           |         print this help |
|  -v           |         verbose mode, shows more information about the computation |
|  -s           |         silent mode, shows no information |
|  -obj      |            write output in wavefront obj format (3D coordinates) |
|  &lt;filename&gt; |           input type is either wavefront obj or GML format |
